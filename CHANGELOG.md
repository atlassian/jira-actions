## Compatibility
The library offers compatibility contracts on the Java API and the POM.

### Java API
The API covers all public Java types from `com.atlassian.performance.tools.jiraactions.api` and its subpackages:

  * [source compatibility]
  * [binary compatibility]
  * [behavioral compatibility] with behavioral contracts expressed via Javadoc

[source compatibility]: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~darcy/OpenJdkDevGuide/OpenJdkDevelopersGuide.v0.777.html#source_compatibility
[binary compatibility]: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~darcy/OpenJdkDevGuide/OpenJdkDevelopersGuide.v0.777.html#binary_compatibility
[behavioral compatibility]: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~darcy/OpenJdkDevGuide/OpenJdkDevelopersGuide.v0.777.html#behavioral_compatibility

### POM
Changing the license is breaking a contract.
Adding a requirement of a major version of a dependency is breaking a contract.
Dropping a requirement of a major version of a dependency is a new contract.
